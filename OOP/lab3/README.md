# lab 3 OOP

## Inheritance

### Task: Add inheritance and make a class hierarchy from the classes made in lab 2
All the entities derive from the abstract Entity class, and can be used in the EntityRepository\<T\> class.

The Characters in the game derive from the Character class, which is also an Entity, to give a base behavior for everything that can interact with each other as game logic.

The GameContext is a composite which holds classes that control the game settings, like Frames and Map.

Further details can be seen in the UML diagrams.
