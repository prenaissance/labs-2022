## Reflection Question

Why are some FastEthernet ports on the switches up while others are down?

**_The ports that are down are not connected to any device. The ports that are up are connected to other devices_**

What could prevent a ping from being sent between the PCs?

**_The switches not being connected or not being configured with ip addresses_**
