# Packet Tracer - Implement Basic Connectivity

## Part 1: Perform a Basic Configuration on S1 and S2

### Step 4: Save the configuration file to NVRAM.

Question:
Which command do you issue to accomplish this step?

`copy running-config startup-config`

### Part 2: Configure the PCs

b. Type the ping command and the IP address for S1 and press Enter.

Packet Tracer PC Command Line 1.0

**PC> ping 192.168.1.253**

Question:
Were you successful? Explain.

_No, the packets timed out. The problem was that the switches were not fully configured. They were not assigned with static ip addresses_

## Part 3: Configure the Switch Management Interface

Configure S1 and S2 with an IP address.

### Step 1: Configure S1 with an IP address.

Switches can be used as plug-and-play devices. This means that they do not need to be configured for them to work. Switches forward information from one port to another based on MAC addresses.

Question:

If this is the case, why would we configure it with an IP address?

_We should configure it with an IP address to have access to a virtual interface_

Use the following commands to configure S1 with an IP address.

```
S1# configure terminal

Enter configuration commands, one per line. End with CNTL/Z.

S1(config)# interface vlan 1

S1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.253 255.255.255.0

S1(config-if)# no shutdown

%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface Vlan1, changed state to up

S1(config-if)#

S1(config-if)# exit

S1#
```

Question:

Why do you enter the no shutdown command?

_The no shutdown command is used to bring up an interface that has been shut down, and that was the default_
